## about

rasmx86-64 (or just rasm) is assembler for x86-64 architecture.

> [!WARNING]
> rasm is still in early development and is not well tested (***there still may be edge cases, but basic usage is functional***). 

## roadmap

- [x] MVP
- [x] Better variable support
- [x] Support for 64-bit ELF
- [ ] Full support for 32-bit (`protected`) and 16-bit (`real`) modes; `cr`, `dr`, `eflags` and `segments` (`cs`, `fs`, etc.)
- [ ] Support for AVX, FPU and SSE x86 (and x86-64) extensions (with AVX-512)
- [ ] Support for atleast 50% of x86-64 instructions
