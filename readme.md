## about

`rasm` is modern and independent assembler for x86-64 architecture as one of key parts in (future project) `RAD` toolchain.

> [!NOTE]
> `rasm` is still in beta phase and should not be relied on for any serious work.

## features

> [!NOTE]
> This info is for `betao` release.

- Support for ~50%+ x86-64 ISA (~848 instructions)
- Support for `SSE*`, `AVX`, `AVX2`, (`AVX512` coming soon) `MMX` and more x86-64 extensions
- Support for 64-bit and 32-bit ELF as export target

## getting started

Firstly you want to download/compile `rasm`'s binary.

Then you should read documentation (`docs`) and see examples (some can be currently found in `tests` directory).

## dev roadmap
